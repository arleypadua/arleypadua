You've seen a summary about me above, but basically I'm a software developer passioned about software architecture and distributed systems.

I'm a truly believer that communication is a powerful tool that brings everybody together in any scenario: from anywhere in life to software architecture.

If you want to read a bit about my ideas, I usually share them on [Medium](https://medium.com/@arleypadua):
